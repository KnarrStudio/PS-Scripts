# PS-ScriptsExamples

This is pretty much what it says it is.  As bunch of script examples.  Some may work, some may not.  I hope that all have something to bring to the table.  If you need to know how to write a function.  There are some examples.  How about a param?  Well there are examples of that too.

Its not pretty, but there is a lot of time and energy stored here.  But, if you find a duplicate or a script that might be better titled, don't be afraid and make that change.

I might only suggest that as we go through these we add the following to it somewhere near the top.
'# Not Operational
'# Operational - If it is then maybe it belongs in the ITPSTools repo.
'# Scrap or example of "while loop"
